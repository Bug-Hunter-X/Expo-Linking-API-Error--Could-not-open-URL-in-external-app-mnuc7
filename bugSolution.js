To handle this error effectively, wrap your Linking.openURL call in a try...catch block.  Additionally, ensure that your URL is correctly formatted and that the necessary permissions are included in your app's configuration (especially for iOS).  Consider adding user-friendly feedback mechanisms, such as a notification or alert, to inform the user if the URL fails to open.  Here's an example of improved code:

```javascript
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';

async function openURL(url) {
  try {
    const supported = await Linking.canOpenURL(url);
    if (supported) {
      await Linking.openURL(url);
    } else {
      Alert.alert('URL not supported', `The URL ${url} could not be opened. Please check the URL or install the necessary app.`);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error opening URL:', error);
    Alert.alert('Error opening URL', `An unexpected error occurred while opening the URL: ${error.message}`);
  }
}
```
This improved solution includes checks for URL support before attempting to open it and robust error handling, providing better user experience and more informative debugging information.
